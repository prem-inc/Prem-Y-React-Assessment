# 🧪 Frontend Assessment: To-Do App Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

This open-book assessment is designed to evaluate your **practical skills** in:

- **JavaScript**
- **React.js**
- **CSS**

We want to assess your ability to build a functional UI using online resources **without directly copy-pasting full answers from AI tools**.

---

## 🛠️ Task Overview

You will build a **To-Do List App** that includes the following core features:

### ✅ Required Features (any one must be fully functional)

- Fetch and render a list of tasks using the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=10` API.
- Add new tasks with a category (e.g., Work, Personal).
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
- Filter tasks based on category.
- Search tasks by text input (e.g., task title).

---

## 🕒 Time Allocation

- You are given **1 hour** to complete this challenge.
- You do **not** have to build everything.
- **One complete working feature** (such as API fetch, add with category, or search with debounce) is must.

---

## 📌 Guidelines

- You can use **any public resources** (MDN, Stack Overflow, blog posts, etc.)
- **Do not use AI-generated complete solutions** (we will compare patterns).
- Add basic styling using plain CSS or inline styles.
---

## 📦 Deliverables

- Submit a `.zip` of your React app or a link to a GitHub repo.
- Make sure your app **runs with `npm install && npm start`**.

---

## 🚫 Plagiarism Note

This is an **open-book** test, not an AI-generated copy-paste contest.

Good luck! Build something clean, and show us how you think like a developer.
